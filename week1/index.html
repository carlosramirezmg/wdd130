    <h2>Carlos Ramirez</h2>
    <h2>Charly</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Carlos Miguel, but you can call me Charly and I live in Guatemala. I'm currently on the path to a career in software development and pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Software Development. Outside of my studies and work as a help desk agent at a call center, I enjoy listening to music and spending quality time with my family. I'm focused on furthering my education to transition into the web and software development field. One of the things I appreciate about BYU-Idaho is its online education resources, which enable me to pursue my degree while working. I believe that acquiring new knowledge and skills in web design will greatly benefit both my personal and professional life, opening up opportunities for better job prospects. I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for 20 years, and one of my favorite scriptures is D&C 58:28, which emphasizes our agency and the rewards of doing good.</p>
